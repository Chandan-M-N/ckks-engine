# ckks-engine

ckks-engine is a Rust crate that provides an implementation of the CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song) homomorphic encryption scheme, enabling encrypted computations on real numbers. With ckks-engine, you can perform a wide range of mathematical operations on encrypted data, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more, all while preserving the privacy of the underlying data.

# Features
- Homomorphic Encryption: Secure encryption of real numbers using the CKKS scheme.
- Encrypted Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more on encrypted data.
- Support for Advanced Operations: Compute averages, medians, floor, ceil, etc., directly on encrypted data.
- Efficient and Scalable: Built for performance with optimizations for both space and time complexity.
